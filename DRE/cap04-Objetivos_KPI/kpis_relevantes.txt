Energy (smart grids):
• efficiency of generation = GE(generated energy)/IE (input energy);
• efficiency of transmission = TE (transmitted energy)/IE.
GHG emissions:
• CO2 at generation = CO2/IE

• Total annual consumption of electricity from the grid
• Total annual consumption of electricity directly purchased from renewable sources
• Total annual consumption of electricity from CHP (combined heat and power)

Energy in data centers:
• power usage effectiveness (PUE) = total facility power/IT equipment power;
• data center infrastructure efficiency (DCiE) = 1/PUE = IT equipment power/total facility power × 100%.
